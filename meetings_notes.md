# Meeting notes

This journal (started on Wednesday the 13th of July) will serve as storage for the notes I take during and after meetings. I find that I take a lot of notes of certain keywords, ideas and recommendations that are given by my supervisors (Dr Helfrid Hochegger and Dr Ivor Simpson) but they are usually in random notes. At least now, they will be in one place, here.

### Wednesday 13th of July, 10:30-11:00
Attendees: Dr Ivor Simpson, Rehan Zuberi
- Talked about where I am right now, what I did, what I have to do until friday, and setting up some time to chart next week about where the project will go (3rd year project and publication and sharing wiht other students such as PhD students in Helfrid's lab who are less Computer Sciency)
- More precisely, I showed Ivor the rules I was applying (the EdU) one and he said that the bins and elbow method to get the background was sensible. He strongly recommended some normalisation of the images before doing this data gathering to make sure there isn't one image that's off that is all classified into one cell.
- Ivor recommended one hot encoding, [0,0,1,0,0] [0,0.5,0.5,0,0] to give the cell cycle phases as some cells can be in transition and we don't want to punish unfairly our classifier for giving a 50/50 chance phase when it is chance and it could just give us the confidence
- I told Ivor that for now I'm applying the rules that Helfrid told me until Friday.
- Ivor wants to setup some time next week to take a step back on the project and make bullet points to know where we go from here. Firstly, how will this project go into being my final year project. Secondly, how can this project and its result be used for publication (useful for him, useful for me). And thirdly, how I can share these resources with other students, especially the ones in Helfrid's lab who are less computer sciency. If they could have an easy to work pipeline in which to put their data and get quantitative results from it, it would be very useful from it.
